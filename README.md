#**Tasks Overview**

### **Task 1 – Basic Python**

Solve three programming problems using Python:

1. **Pokémon Team Builder**  
   - From a given list of Pokémon and their types, make all possible squads of size *k*.  
   - Find the *strongest squad* for each *k* (the one that covers the most unique types).  
   - If multiple squads have the same strength, show them all.

2. **Hermione’s Spell**  
   - Hermione is picking glowing runes (letters) one by one.  
   - Find the *earliest step* where she can spell the word **LUMOS** (order doesn’t matter).  
   - If she never can, return `-1`.

3. **Bombing Islands**  
   - Given a square map (*n x n*) with land (`1`) and water (`0`), you have one bomb of size *m x m*.  
   - Drop it where it destroys the *most land pieces*.  
   - Report the *coordinates* and the *number of land cells destroyed*.
